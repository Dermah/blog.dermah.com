title: Git Superpowers I â€“ Lightning Talk 2020-03-17
layout: post
---

This is a lightning talk I gave at my work about using Git to give you superpowers. It was mostly a live command line demo, so it is presented here as a shell script with accompanying console output.

Weâ€™re going to learn to:

- commit only part of the changes in your working directory
- unzip one feature branch in to two feature branches
- recover lost commits and stashes

<!-- excerpt -->

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# lightning-talk.sh

# Say I'm a developer and I've got a JIRA ticket that says we have to
# improve the friendly language on the login page to make it more inviting.
# My JIRA ticket has two subtasks, the first one (DEV-999999-really-cool-component)
# is the task for creating the <Text> component because we don't have one of those yet.
# The second subtask (DEV-111111-cool-component-on-login) is to actually use the
# component on the login screen.
# In my git history, I currently have a bunch of commits on my DEV-999999 branch.
# Unfortunately I got carried away and also started the second ticket on this branch.
# As a courtesy to the reviewers, I am going to split this branch into two branches,
# one for each ticket. This will help reviewers by givving them smaller diffs to review.
# I've been pretty good at how I form my commits so far, so it should be a matter of
# unzipping those commits into each branch.
```

# connected to your commit graph anymore. It's still there... somewhere
# We just have to find it. We can try the reflog. Sometimes that's handy if you delete
# a branch like I just deleted my backup branch and it's still there
git reflog
# This gives you a log of all the reference changes that have happend, opened in `less`.
# You can navigate around or type `/` to search.

# In my case though, stashes aren't really on branches so they wont show up in the reflog.
# Instead I had to find a hairy looking command on Stack Overflow to get it back.
# It uses the fsck command to find all dangling commits in my local git repo like this:
git fsck --no-reflog | awk '/dangling commit/ {print $3}'
# Not useful on its own but if you pump it in to the git log command you can get all the
# log messages next to the commit hashes:
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all $( git fsck --no-reflog | awk '/dangling commit/ {print $3}' )
# Look for commits that start with WIP because that's the convention the `git stash`
#  command uses
# You can do `git show <commit>` to find what's in the commit. Now I can get it back by
# cherry-picking (without committing) the commit on to my branch
git cherry-pick eb60d408 -n -m 1
# Tada I rescued a stash from oblivion yey
